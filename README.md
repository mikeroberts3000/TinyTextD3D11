This repository contains an updated version of James Bird's Tiny Text rendering library. I updated this library for D3D11 and provided C# bindings that integrate seamlessly with SlimDX. The original Tiny Text rendering library can be obtained at http://www.jb101.co.uk/2009/05/29/tiny-text-rendering-library-for-directx-10/
